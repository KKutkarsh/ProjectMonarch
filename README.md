# ProjectMonarch
## Introduction
You are receiving this task to evaluate your ability to solve
problems using code. Please follow the instructions in this
document on how to complete the task.
## The task
You need to develop a project that will fetch a list of monarchs
from an online data source and produce various statistics about
them.
The source data can be found here(https://gist.githubusercontent.com/christianpanton/10d65ccef9f29de3acd49d97ed423736/raw/b09563bc0c4b318132c7a738e679d4f984ef0048/kings).

Your application needs to fetch the data, convert it into a local
data representation and answer the following questions:
1. How many monarchs are in the dataset?
2. Which monarch ruled the longest and for how many years?
3. Which house ruled the longest and for how many years?
4. What is the most common first name in the dataset?
5. What is the house of the current monarch and for how many
years did that house rule throughout history?

## Advice and Considerations
Consider the following points when developing the solution:

## Task
• The monarchs are real monarchs from the history of
England and the United Kingdom.

## Technical
• Use C# and .NET 6, unless other language or framework
has been agreed upon beforehand.
• Do not try to over-engineer the solution, keep it simple and
clear.
• If necessary, document your choices using code comments.
• You can answer the questions by printing to the standard
output.
• Once complete, please send us your implementation in one
file, i.e. ”Program.cs”, unless other delivery method has
been agreed upon beforehand.
